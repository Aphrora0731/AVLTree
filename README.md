# AVLTree
AVL Tree c++ implementation

/*-----------*/

Main AVLTree methods are implemented in AVLTree.cpp such as balancePath, deleteNode and some others,
the rest is inherited from BinarySearchTree class.

useAVL.cpp is a source code where AVLTree and BSTTree are used, tested and compared.
When AVL is compared to BST, there's no big differences in search, when elements are inserted in random order.


###### How to use

compile using gnu gcc

        g++ useAVL.cpp BinarySearchTree.cpp AVLTree.cpp -w -p
